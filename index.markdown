SPGoding is some random human-alike thing that happens to know a little bit about TypeScript, NodeJS, ES6, word combinations that don't make any sense but recruiters love to see, and Kotlin.

# Open Source Projects

## SPYGlass

SPYGlass is a set of development tools for vanilla Minecraft: Java Edition data pack creators. [Learn more][spyglass].

## SPU

[SPU][spu] is an online tool for updating old Minecraft: Java Edition commands to the 1.14 format. [Check it out][spu].

This tool is no longer maintained. SPYGlass might be a good alternative that provides code actions to help you update your data packs.

## SPX

[SPX][spx] is an online tool that can convert [Minecraft.net][minecraftdotnet] blog articles to [BBCode][bbcode]. [Check it out][spx].

It also contains a list of Simplified Chinese translations contributed by Chinese players. Unfortunately, the community behind it is no longer active for obvious reasons.

âš  Warning: the main interface of this tool is not in English.

# Self-Hosted Websites

## Localization

SPGoding has a self-hosted [Weblate][weblate] instance. [Check it out][l10n].

If you want to host your project's localization on this website for free, please [contact][contact] SPGoding. Generally, any open source projects related to Minecraft are allowed.

## Search Engine

SPGoding also has a self-hosted [Searx][searx] instance. If you're brave enough to hand all your search history and privacy to me, [check it out][searx].

You probably won't be tracked, but I can't guarantee anything.
