SPGoding is some random human-alike thing that happens to know a little bit about TypeScript, NodeJS, ES6, word combinations that don't make any sense but recruiters love to see, and Kotlin.

# Project Compass

## SPYGlass

SPYGlass is a set of development tools for vanilla Minecraft: Java Edition content creators. [Learn more][spyglass].

## SPU

[SPU][spu] is an online tool for updating old Minecraft: Java Edition commands to the 1.14 format. [Check it out][spu].

## Localization

SPGoding has a self-hosted [Weblate][weblate] instance. [Check it out][l10n].

## Search Engine
